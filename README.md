# MVDA_exploration_tools

Multivariate data analysis (MVDA) exploration tool is a Python library utilizing the scikit-learn library for partial least squares (PLS) and principal components analysis (PCA). <br><br>
Additionally, an example Jupyter notebook shows how to use the pandas library for row and column labelling prior to PCA and PLS modelling.
